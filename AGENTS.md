# Agent rules — Surmount Grok OSS

Concise rules for work in this repository. Global GPG and subagent rules also
apply (`~/.grok/AGENTS.md`).

## Hard constraints

1. **Never run `git commit`.** Commits are human-only on a real TTY (signed).
   Agents may do complex git labor when asked (conflict resolve, merge setup,
   history diagnosis), then **stage and hand** exact `git commit -S …`
   commands — including after “fix conflicts” / “make the PR mergeable” /
   even “commit this.” Do **not** push unless he explicitly asked to push.
   Full policy: `~/.grok/AGENTS.md` § *Commits — agents never commit*.
2. **Never bypass GPG** (`commit.gpgsign=false`, `--no-gpg-sign`, fake
   `gpg.program`, hook disables, etc.).
3. **Never bulk find-and-replace.** Bulk **find** (`rg`) is fine. Edits must
   be surgical and reviewed in context.
4. **Talk to humans in plain language.** No pack of opaque acronyms, false
   either/or menus, or planning jargon (phases, tracks, workstreams) in user
   replies, product docs, tests, or **filenames**.

## Regressions and deep diagnosis

- Do **not** investigate regressions or multi-file diagnosis in the parent
  thread (no parent-marathon of greps, logs, or long code walks). Spawn tightly
  scoped subagents; join on short on-disk summaries only.
- Full rule: `~/.grok/AGENTS.md` § *Regressions and deep diagnosis — never in
  the parent thread*.

## When you ship product work

- Update **[`FORK.md`](FORK.md)** with a short hierarchical note (what changed
  for Grok OSS). Link out for detail; do not write novels in FORK.
- Prefer existing living docs over new ephemeral notes.

## CI and quality

- **CI is for checks only** — never a release package build in GHA (supply
  chain). Humans package with `just build` / install recipes when needed.
- Full local gate (same idea as GHA quality): **`just check`** or **`just ci`**.
  Run before push. No pre-commit hook is required for that.
- There is no `ci-quick` or `ci-host` recipe.

## Git flow

- Feature branches → pull request → **`main`**. Tool branches (`import/*`,
  `onto-xai/*`) are not a second product main; they land through PRs.

## Upstream (xAI)

- Prefer **product commits on their current tip** when histories break
  (`scripts/put-history-on-xai.sh` — real cherry-pick). Then **join Surmount
  `main`** into that tip (`scripts/join-main-into-onto.sh`, `merge -s ours`)
  so the branch is PR-able. See [`docs/upstream-history.md`](docs/upstream-history.md).
- **Import** absorbs their tree into Surmount history (different job).
- This fork exists because upstream does not accept external PRs. If that
  changes, open a PR to contribute.

## Residual

- [`RESIDUAL.md`](RESIDUAL.md) holds **open** human-intent or unfinished honesty
  items only. When something is finished, move the lasting truth into FORK or
  the right process doc — do not leave it only in residual.

## Naming

- `xai-*` crates and paths stay for mergeability with upstream.
- Surmount-only crates and product names use **`grok-*`** / **`grok-oss`**
  (no `xai-` prefix on novel fork crates).
